# Technical and implementation issues

The objective of this session is to present perspectives on the technical designs, implications, and details of implementation that OpenGIS predicates, promotes, and progresses.

## Presentations

- [Andrew Turner OpenGIS](http://ajturner.github.io/presentations/aag2014/)


## Technical Aspects of Open

* Source Code
* Specifications
* Licensing
* Data
* Content

## Source Code

* Intellectual Property
* Languages and Frameworks
 * What language to learn?
 * Scripting vs. Programming vs. Engineering
* API's as 'libraries'
 * is an 'open API' like an 'open source library'?
 * implications of vendor driven (changeable) API's?
* Licensing
 * well understood

## Specifications

* Community driven versus Standards Bodies
 * 56 standards in 1 year is too much
* Complexity versus Pragmatism
* Education, Awareness
* Evolution
* Deprecation - who decides a standard is EOL? (e.g. IE7)

## Licensing

Machine-readable licensing. Clearly defined rules, combinations. How to resolve derivatives of `CC-By-SA + ODbL = ?` 

## Data

* Formats
 * [Geopackage](http://www.geopackage.org/) - Shapefile of the future?
  * [Demo of Geopackage with ArcGIS and Open Source](https://github.com/mhogeweg/geopackage)
 * Linked Open Data - [geojson-ld](https://github.com/geojson/geojson-ld)
* Licensing
* Derivatives
